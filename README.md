Ece Irmak Tulcali

First of all i want to thank you teachers for showing everything and begum and sera for helping me to create this repository. 
Sugar on my tongue is a project to have fun. But at the same time i am very inspired by Tyler, the creator who owns that song, how the way he existing and creating. He is doing everything his own and he approaches to music as a whole, complete.So, that is why i picked this song and him, also picking a song was so HARD. I did 3 different projects cause i couldn't decide to song. For the mood and colors i inspired by Gaspar noe :) of course. Not too many people knows but he shot a music video for Travis Scott, it is crazy, you should check!! :)) the song called Modern Jam.


In this project, tongues are having fun.
